# Clarinet-Base
A `Base` `Clarinet` environment to quick start the Clarity development experience

## Purpose:
This repository is intended to be a `Base` `Clarinet` environment for developers. This environment should be a quick path to creating a local development environment that will have standard contracts  and tokens such as BNS, POX, a standard SIP-009, and a standard SIP-010 token (and more!) pre-deployed to your local environment so that the work of setting up your environment is already complete. The SIP-009 and SIP-010 tokens will have easy to use utility functions that can be used for testing purposes in conjunction with whatever project/product/tool the developer is developing. 

Note: The developer should go through the exercise of setting up this type of environment at least one time to be familiar with what is going on behind the scenes. This tool is meant for ease-of-use for jump-starting a new project.
